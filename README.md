# Collegiate Resource Hub

### This is a Next.js/TailwindCSS project utilizing the Merriam-Webster Inc API of the Collegiate Dictionary and Collegiate Thesaurus endpoints.

### This API has many multi-level nested arrays and requires some deep digging to map over the sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, and so on.

### I chose this API to better my skills with Third-Party API, as I found the way this API is set up, you have no option but to write advanced JavaScript functions and manage state in the way of conditional and dynamic rendering of elements, components, and data.

This is an on-going project and is in its infant stages with a few issues still lingering, but I felt it was ( at least ) at MVP status, so I have decided to go ahead and make it public.
